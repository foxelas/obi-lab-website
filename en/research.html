        Research on ensuring the safety of social information infrastructure
      </h2>
      <p>
        We conduct research to ensure the safety of social information
        infrastructure. In order to enable the safe distribution of information
        such as medical information, it is extremely important to verify the
        identity and control access, and to ensure interoperability between
        information systems by standardizing the functions of devices. In our
        laboratory, we investigate how to safely use various devices on the
        network while fully optimizing the performance, for example using
        devices with authentication function via a multifunctional IC chip. We
        are conducting research aimed at establishing the framework necessary
        for the safe use of various devices on networks.

        In addition, with the aim of realizing the ideal form of the
        next-generation e-government, we are participating in the Solution
        Research Organization / Advanced Research Center for Social Information
        Science And Technology established at our university and conducting
        joint research. Here, we are conducting research and efforts toward the
        realization of public systems that enable people to directly and
        actively utilize their various information, such as the My Number
        system. For example, Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram for confirming
        insurance qualifications using the Basic Resident Register Card at a
        medical institution. To achieve this, examination of the specifications
        of public IC cards is required, along with examination of the my number
        system for identifying individuals in the medical field, etc. We are
        developing various technologies that are directly related to people's
        lives.

      <h2>Research on medical bioimaging</h2>
      <p>
        Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and X-ray CT occupy an important
        position in diagnosis as a technique for imaging information inside the
        human body from data collected outside the body. In our laboratory, we
        are developing a method to accurately collect the structure and function
        of the body as an image for the purpose of enabling early detection of
        diseases and highly accurate image diagnosis. The internal distribution
        image (reconstruction image) of the physical quantity targeted by these
        medical imaging devices is estimated from the observation data using the
        image reconstruction method. Conventional image reconstruction methods
        may not be able to fully utilize the observed information due to various
        restrictions of the observation system. In our laboratory, we have
        developed a method to accurately describe the characteristics of the
        observation system and perform statistical image reconstruction, and
        apply it to various objects.

        A specific theme is the estimation of dynamic function images that
        represent the functional information of living organisms, which is one
        of the targets for using PET devices. Since the dynamic functional image
        is estimated using the plasma time activity curve (plasma Time Activity
        Curve) and the tissue time activity curve (tTAC), the estimated accuracy
        of the functional image. Is known to be highly dependent on the accuracy
        of tTAC. We are currently developing a four-dimensional reconstruction
        method based on DRAMA (Dynamic Row Action Maximum-Likelihood Algorithm)
        reconstruction as a method for estimating tTAC faster and with higher
        accuracy. Figure 1 is an example of the estimation result using the
        method proposed in our laboratory, but it can be seen that accurate
        results are obtained with a small number of iterations.
