        At Obi Laboratory, we are researching new biometric technologies
        necessary for investigating human biological activities, especially
        image processing technologies necessary for elucidating biological
        functions. We are also conducting research on social information system
        technology necessary for solving various social issues and building
        social infrastructure that allows users to safely use medical
        information.

        Obi Laboratory belongs to the Institute of Innovative Research of our
        university. We accept undergraduate and graduate students of the School
        of Engineering's Information and Communications Engineering department
        to conduct education and research. In addition, since we are conducting
        research in collaboration with faculty members belonging to the Advanced
        Research Center for Social Information Science And Technology, you can
        select a research theme from a wide range of themes related to the
        medical and the social information fields.
